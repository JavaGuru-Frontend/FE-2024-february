High motivated, excellent experience with strong organizational skills. Achieves company goals through exceptional planning and prioritization.

I am an experienced Truck operator with more than four years on Scandic roads.

My time as an operator/driver has taught me the value of providing high-quality, fast, and accurate service. I understand how companies operate and what customers want, and do not settle for less than the best. I am well-versed in maintaining documentation and daily logs, planning efficient routes, and securing all types of loads.

I possess a clean driving record, have completed C professional truck driving school, and maintain a current C 95 code license. Safety is a high priority for me, and I consistently adhere to company guidelines, regulatory requirements, and standard operating procedures for the industry.
